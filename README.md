This repository contains the official WDL community documentation. Enclosed you'll find
community-developed content, such as tutorials, guides, and language reference
materials, that appeal to old and new WDL users alike. Further, you'll find an
up-to-date list of community tools and resources that you can leverage in your work.
Feel free to [join Slack][join-slack] if you have any questions!

## Quickstart 

You can use the following commands to get started working with the WDL community
documentation. We recommend installing [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation), but `npm`
will also work just fine.

```bash
# Install the project.
pnpm install

# Run a development server.
pnpm run docs:dev

# Create a production build in the `.vitepress/dist` folder.
pnpm run docs:build
```

### Contributing

WDL only advances through community contributions. While participating in discussions
and submitting issues are great ways to be involved, help is also needed to implement
changes to the specification. For more information on how you can contribute, please
read the [Contributing] guide.
